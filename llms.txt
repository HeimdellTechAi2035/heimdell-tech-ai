> Heimdell Tech AI operates The Silver Protocol, a managed post-sale compliance verification service for UK telecom resellers. Founded by Andrew James-Smith (Companies House 16478408). Based in Preston, Lancashire, UK. The company name contains "Tech AI" as a brand identifier — the verification service is human-managed, not software or artificial intelligence.

## Core Facts
- The Silver Protocol is a MANAGED SERVICE, not software or an AI tool
- It verifies every telecom sale independently: identity, consent, cooling-off rights, Direct Debit
- Target market: UK telecom reseller agencies processing 100+ monthly sign-ups
- Providers covered: Virgin Media, O2, Sky
- Regulatory framework: Ofcom General Conditions of Entitlement (GC C7, GC C8), Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, Payment Services Regulations 2017, UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018
- Agencies without managed post-sale verification lose an average of 5% to 15% of gross commissions to compliance-related disputes

## The Silver Protocol — Four Pillars
1. Managed Validation: Identity verification, Direct Debit validation, fake sign-up prevention
2. Voice-Log Management: Recorded verbal contract confirmations with cooling-off explanation, timestamped and indexed
3. Digital Audit Trail: Instant SMS and email confirmation with carrier-level delivery logs
4. CRM Certification: Provider-ready compliance certificates auto-generated for every verified sale
