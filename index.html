                    <p>Heimdell Tech AI exists for one reason: to ensure every legitimate sale your agency closes is fully verified, properly documented and permanently defensible. We operate The Silver Protocol as a managed compliance verification service &mdash; independent from your sales operation, aligned entirely with your commercial interest.</p>
                    <p>Our service eliminates disputed sign-ups, reduces provider audit exposure and creates an unbroken chain of evidence from the moment a sale is logged to the moment commission is banked.</p>

The service is designed for agencies processing 100 or more monthly sign-ups.</p>

                <h2>How Much Commission Do UK Telecom Resellers Lose to Compliance Gaps?</h2>
                <p class="section-desc" style="margin:0 auto;">Most telecom resellers underestimate the financial impact of unverified sales. The numbers below reflect a conservative scenario.</p>
                <blockquote style="max-width:720px;margin:24px auto 0;background:var(--dark-card);border-left:4px solid var(--gold);border-radius:0 12px 12px 0;padding:20px 24px;font-size:0.95rem;line-height:1.7;color:var(--text-secondary);">According to Heimdell Tech AI&rsquo;s internal analysis of UK telecom reseller operations, agencies without an independent post-sale verification layer lose an average of 5% to 15% of gross commissions to compliance-related disputes, including cooling-off cancellations without documented acknowledgement, unverified customer identities flagged during provider audit, and missing Direct Debit mandate consent records. At 100 monthly sign-ups with an average commission of &pound;200 per sale, this equates to &pound;12,000 to &pound;36,000 in preventable annual leakage. The Silver Protocol eliminates this exposure by certifying every sale before it reaches the provider.</blockquote>

                    <p>I built The Silver Protocol because I&rsquo;ve lived the problem it solves. After years working in UK telecom reselling, I saw first-hand how compliance gaps and undocumented sales were silently destroying commission &mdash; not because agents were doing anything wrong, but because there was no system in place to prove they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
                    <p>Disputes would surface weeks after a sale. Providers would claw back commission with no warning. Cooling-off challenges went unanswered because there was no recorded evidence, no timestamped confirmations, and no audit trail. The ROI was being eroded by a problem nobody was actively solving.</p>
                    <p>So I built the solution myself. The Silver Protocol is the managed compliance layer I wished existed when I was losing revenue to preventable disputes. Every feature &mdash; from voice-log verification to instant SMS confirmations to provider-ready certificates &mdash; was designed to close the exact gaps I experienced in the field. <a href="about.html">Read the full story &rarr;</a></p>

                            <strong>It creates a compliance certificate for every sale, removing the grounds for clawbacks.</strong> Commission clawbacks typically occur when a provider disputes the validity of a sale &mdash; often citing missing cooling-off confirmation, unverified identity or absent contract acknowledgements. The Silver Protocol independently verifies every sale after it is logged, producing a compliance certificate that includes ID confirmation, key term acknowledgement, cooling-off confirmation, Direct Debit validation, a voice recording reference and a timestamp. This certificate satisfies provider audit requirements and removes the grounds for disputed commissions.

                            <strong>Under 5 minutes — triggered instantly when a sale is logged.</strong> The Silver Protocol is triggered immediately after a sale is logged. The customer receives a verification call within minutes of sign-up. Identity validation, verbal confirmation of key terms, cooling-off explanation and recording are completed during a single managed interaction. SMS and email confirmations are dispatched instantly upon completion. The compliance certificate is generated and pushed to your CRM in real time.
